For exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates, the assignment of exposures shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria: \\n\\n(a) each obligor shall be assigned to an obligor grade as part of the credit approval process;\\n\\n(b) for those exposures for which an institution has received the permission of the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors pursuant to Article 143, each exposure shall also be assigned to a facility grade as part of the credit approval process;\\n\\n(c) institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures shall assign each of these exposures to a grade in accordance with Article 170(2);\\n\\n(d) each separate legal entity to which the institution is exposed shall be separately rated;\\n\\n(e) separate exposures to the same obligor shall be assigned to the same obligor grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction. However, where separate exposures are allowed to result in multiple grades for the same obligor, the following shall apply: \\n\\n(i) country transfer risk, this being dependent on whether the exposures are denominated in local or foreign currency;\\n\\n(ii) the treatment of associated guarantees to an exposure may be reflected in an adjusted assignment to an obligor grade;\\n\\n(iii) consumer protection, bank secrecy or other legislation prohibit the exchange of client data.

This consistency shall exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations;\\n\\n(b) the documentation of the rating process shall allow third parties to understand the assignments of exposures to grades or pools, to replicate grade and pool assignments and to evaluate the appropriateness of the assignments to a grade or a pool;\\n\\n(c) the criteria shall also be consistent with the institution's internal lending standards and its policies for handling troubled obligors and facilities. 2. An institution shall take all relevant information into account in assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools. Information shall be current and shall enable the institution to forecast the future performance of the exposure. The less information an institution has, the more conservative shall be its assignments of exposures to obligor and facility grades or pools.

For exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates, the assignment process shall meet the following requirements: \\n\\n(a) Assignments and periodic reviews of assignments shall be completed or approved by an independent party that does not directly benefit from decisions to extend the credit;\\n\\n(b) Institutions shall review assignments at least annually and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. High risk obligors and problem exposures shall be subject to more frequent review. Institutions shall undertake a new assignment if material information on the obligor or exposure becomes available;\\n\\n(c) An institution shall have an effective process to obtain and update relevant information on obligor characteristics that affect PDs, and on transaction characteristics that affect LGDs or conversion factors. 2. For retail exposures, an institution shall at least annually review obligor and facility assignments and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment, or review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk pool, whichever applicable. An institution shall also at least annually review in a representative sample the status of individual exposures within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool, and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. 3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards setting out the methodologies of the competent authorities to assess the integrity of the assignment process and the regular and independent assessment of risks. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2026.

Once an institution has implemented the IRB Approach for a certain type of exposures within an exposure class, it shall do so for all exposures within that exposure class, unless it has received the permission of the competent authority to use the Standardised Approach permanently in accordance with Article 150. Subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, implementation of the IRB Approach may be carried out sequentially across the different types of exposures within a certain exposure class within the same business unit and across different business units in the same group, or for the use of own estimates of LGD or for the use of IRB-CCF. 2. Competent authorities shall determine the period over which an institution and any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries shall be required to implement the IRB Approach for all exposures within a certain exposure class across different types of exposures within the same business unit and across different business units in the same group, or for the use of own estimates of LGD or for the use of IRB-CCF. That period shall be one that competent authorities consider to be appropriate on the basis of the nature and scale of the activities of the institution concerned, or of any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries, and the number and nature of rating systems to be implemented. 3. Institutions shall carry out implementation of the IRB Approach in accordance with conditions determined by the competent authorities.

An institution shall take all relevant information into account in assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools. Information shall be current and shall enable the institution to forecast the future performance of the exposure. The less information an institution has, the more conservative shall be its assignments of exposures to obligor and facility grades or pools. If an institution uses an external rating as a primary factor determining an internal rating assignment, the institution shall ensure that it considers other relevant information. 3.

Significant concentrations within a single grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the obligor grade covers a reasonably narrow PD band and that the default risk posed by all obligors in the grade falls within that band;\\n\\n(e) to be permitted by the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs for own funds requirement calculation, a rating system shall incorporate a distinct facility rating scale which exclusively reflects LGD related transaction characteristics. The facility grade definition shall include both a description of how exposures are assigned to the grade and of the criteria used to distinguish the level of risk across grades;\\n\\n(f) significant concentrations within a single facility grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the facility grade covers a reasonably narrow LGD band, respectively, and that the risk posed by all exposures in the grade falls within that band. 2.

The obligor rating scale shall have a minimum of 7 grades for non-defaulted obligors and one for defaulted obligors;\\n\\n(c) an institution shall document the relationship between obligor grades in terms of the level of default risk each grade implies and the criteria used to distinguish that level of default risk;\\n\\n(d) institutions with portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of default risk shall have enough obligor grades within that range to avoid undue concentrations of obligors in a particular grade. Significant concentrations within a single grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the obligor grade covers a reasonably narrow PD band and that the default risk posed by all obligors in the grade falls within that band;\\n\\n(e) to be permitted by the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs for own funds requirement calculation, a rating system shall incorporate a distinct facility rating scale which exclusively reflects LGD related transaction characteristics. The facility grade definition shall include both a description of how exposures are assigned to the grade and of the criteria used to distinguish the level of risk across grades;\\n\\n(f) significant concentrations within a single facility grade shall be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the facility grade covers a reasonably narrow LGD band, respectively, and that the risk posed by all exposures in the grade falls within that band. 2. Institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures are exempt from the requirement to have an obligor rating scale which reflects exclusively quantification of the risk of obligor default for these exposures.
