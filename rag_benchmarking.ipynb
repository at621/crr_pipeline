For exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates, the assignment of exposures shall be carried out in accordance with the following criteria: \\n\\n(a) each obligor shall be assigned to an obligor grade as part of the credit approval process;\\n\\n(b) for those exposures for which an institution has received the permission of the competent authority to use own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors pursuant to Article 143, each exposure shall also be assigned to a facility grade as part of the credit approval process;\\n\\n(c) institutions using the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights for specialised lending exposures shall assign each of these exposures to a grade in accordance with Article 170(2);\\n\\n(d) each separate legal entity to which the institution is exposed shall be separately rated;\\n\\n(e) separate exposures to the same obligor shall be assigned to the same obligor grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction. However, where separate exposures are allowed to result in multiple grades for the same obligor, the following shall apply: \\n\\n(i) country transfer risk, this being dependent on whether the exposures are denominated in local or foreign currency;\\n\\n(ii) the treatment of associated guarantees to an exposure may be reflected in an adjusted assignment to an obligor grade;\\n\\n(iii) consumer protection, bank secrecy or other legislation prohibit the exchange of client data.

For exposures to central governments and central banks, exposures to regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities, exposures to institutions and exposures to corporates, the assignment process shall meet the following requirements: \\n\\n(a) Assignments and periodic reviews of assignments shall be completed or approved by an independent party that does not directly benefit from decisions to extend the credit;\\n\\n(b) Institutions shall review assignments at least annually and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. High risk obligors and problem exposures shall be subject to more frequent review. Institutions shall undertake a new assignment if material information on the obligor or exposure becomes available;\\n\\n(c) An institution shall have an effective process to obtain and update relevant information on obligor characteristics that affect PDs, and on transaction characteristics that affect LGDs or conversion factors. 2. For retail exposures, an institution shall at least annually review obligor and facility assignments and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment, or review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk pool, whichever applicable. An institution shall also at least annually review in a representative sample the status of individual exposures within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool, and adjust the assignment where the result of the review does not justify carrying forward the current assignment. 3. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards setting out the methodologies of the competent authorities to assess the integrity of the assignment process and the regular and independent assessment of risks. EBA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 10 July 2026.

Once an institution has implemented the IRB Approach for a certain type of exposures within an exposure class, it shall do so for all exposures within that exposure class, unless it has received the permission of the competent authority to use the Standardised Approach permanently in accordance with Article 150. Subject to the prior permission of the competent authorities, implementation of the IRB Approach may be carried out sequentially across the different types of exposures within a certain exposure class within the same business unit and across different business units in the same group, or for the use of own estimates of LGD or for the use of IRB-CCF. 2. Competent authorities shall determine the period over which an institution and any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries shall be required to implement the IRB Approach for all exposures within a certain exposure class across different types of exposures within the same business unit and across different business units in the same group, or for the use of own estimates of LGD or for the use of IRB-CCF. That period shall be one that competent authorities consider to be appropriate on the basis of the nature and scale of the activities of the institution concerned, or of any parent undertaking and its subsidiaries, and the number and nature of rating systems to be implemented. 3. Institutions shall carry out implementation of the IRB Approach in accordance with conditions determined by the competent authorities.

An institution shall take all relevant information into account in assigning obligors and facilities to grades or pools. Information shall be current and shall enable the institution to forecast the future performance of the exposure. The less information an institution has, the more conservative shall be its assignments of exposures to obligor and facility grades or pools. If an institution uses an external rating as a primary factor determining an internal rating assignment, the institution shall ensure that it considers other relevant information. 3.

In exceptional circumstances, exposures to public-sector entities may be treated as exposures to the central government, regional government or local authority in whose jurisdiction they are established where in the opinion of the competent authorities of this jurisdiction there is no difference in risk between such exposures because of the existence of an appropriate guarantee by the central government, regional government or local authority. EBA shall maintain a publicly available database of all public sector entities within the Union referred to in the first subparagraph. 5. When competent authorities of a third country jurisdiction, which apply supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union, treat exposures to public sector entities in accordance with paragraph 1 or 2, institutions may risk weight exposures to such public sector entities in the same manner. Otherwise the institutions shall apply a risk weight of 100 %. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Commission may adopt, by way of implementing acts, and subject to the examination procedure referred to in Article 464(2), a decision as to whether a third country applies supervisory and regulatory arrangements at least equivalent to those applied in the Union. In the absence of such a decision, until 1 January 2015, institutions may continue to apply the treatment set out in this paragraph to the third country where the relevant competent authorities had approved the third country as eligible for that treatment before 1 January 2014.   \n",
