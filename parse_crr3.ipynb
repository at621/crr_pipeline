       "      <td>Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 is amended as follows: (1) the following Chapter is added in Title IV: ‘CHAPTER 4 Calculations and reporting for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 Article 50a Calculation of KCCP 1. For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms ( *1 ), a CCP shall calculate KCCP as specified in paragraph 2 of this Article for all contracts and transactions it clears for all its clearing members falling within the coverage of the given default fund. 2. A CCP shall calculate the hypothetical capital (KCCP) as follows: where: EBRMi = exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member; IMi = the initial margin posted to the CCP by clearing member i; DFi = the pre-funded contribution of clearing member i; RW = a risk weight of 20 %; capital ratio = 8 %. All values in the formula in the first subparagraph shall relate to the valuation at the end of the day before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged. 3. A CCP shall undertake the calculation required by paragraph 2 at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those of its clearing members which are institutions. 4. For the purpose of paragraph 3, EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following: (a) the frequency and dates of the calculation laid down in paragraph 2; (b) the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of calculation and reporting than those referred to in point (a). EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 50b General rules for the calculation of KCCP For the purposes of the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2), the following shall apply: (a) a CCP shall calculate the value of the exposures it has to its clearing members as follows: (i) for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the mark-to-market method laid down in Article 274 thereof; (ii) for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b), (c) and (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation.

underlying exposure and the short positions involve no counterparty risk; (ii) either both the long and the short positions are held in the trading book or both are held in the non-trading book; (b)

those indices; (c) institutions may net gross long positions in own Additional Tier 1 instruments resulting from holdings of index securities against short positions in own Additional Tier 1 instruments resulting from short positions in the underlying indices, including where those short positions involve counterparty risk, provided that both the following conditions are met: (i) the long and short positions are in the same underlying indices; (ii) either both the long and the short positions are held in the trading book or both are held in the non-trading book;   \n",

Exposures to institutions for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available shall be assigned to one of the following grades: (a) where all of the following conditions are met, exposures to institutions shall be assigned to Grade A: (i) the institution has adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments, including repayments of principal and interest, in a timely manner, for the projected life of the assets or exposures and irrespective of economic cycles and business conditions; (ii) the institution meets or exceeds the requirement laid down in Article 92(1) of this Regulation, taking into account Article 458(2), points (d)(i) and (vi), and Article 459, point (a), of this Regulation where applicable, the specific own funds requirements referred to in Article 104 of Directive 2013/36/EU, the combined buffer requirement defined in Article 128, point (6), of Directive 2013/36/EU, or any equivalent and additional local supervisory or regulatory requirements in third countries insofar as those requirements are published and are to be met by Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital or own funds, as applicable; (iii) information about whether the requirements referred to in point (ii) of this point are met or exceeded by the institution is publicly disclosed or otherwise made available to the lending institution; (iv) the assessment performed by the lending institution in accordance with Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU has not revealed that the institution does not meet the conditions set out in points (i) and (ii) of this point; (b) where all of the following conditions are met and at least one of the conditions in point (a) of this paragraph is not met, exposures to institutions shall be assigned to Grade B: (i) the institution is subject to substantial credit risk, including repayment capacities that are dependent on stable or favourable economic or business conditions; (ii) the institution meets or exceeds the requirement laid down in Article 92(1) of this Regulation, taking into account Article 458(2), point (d)(i), and Article 459, point (a), of this Regulation, where applicable, the specific own funds requirements referred to in Article 104 of Directive 2013/36/EU, or any equivalent and additional local supervisory or regulatory requirements in third countries insofar as those requirements are published and are to be met by Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital or own funds, as applicable; (iii) information about whether the requirements referred to in point (ii) of this point are met or exceeded by the institution is publicly disclosed or otherwise made available to the lending institution; (iv) the assessment performed by the lending institution in accordance with Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU has not revealed that the institution does not meet the conditions set out in points (i) and (ii) of this point. (c) where exposures to institutions are not assigned to Grade A or B, or where any of the following conditions is met, exposures to institutions shall be assigned to Grade C: (i) the institution has material default risks and limited margins of safety; (ii) adverse business, financial or economic conditions are very likely to lead, or have led, to the institution’s inability to meet its financial commitments; (iii) where audited financial statements are required by law for the institution, the external auditor has issued an adverse audit opinion or has expressed substantial doubt about the institution’s ability to continue as a going concern in its audited financial statements or audited reports within the previous 12 months. For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (b)(ii), of this paragraph, equivalent and additional local supervisory or regulatory requirements shall not include capital buffers equivalent to those defined in Article 128 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 2. For exposures to financial institutions that are treated as exposures to institutions in accordance with Article 119(5), for the purpose of assessing whether the conditions set out in paragraph 1, points (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), of this Article are met by those financial institutions, institutions shall assess whether those financial institutions meet or exceed any comparable prudential requirements. 3. Exposures assigned to Grade A, B or C in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be assigned a risk weight as follows: (a) exposures assigned to Grade A, B or C which meet any of the following conditions shall be assigned a risk weight for short-term exposures in accordance with Table 1: (i) the exposure has an original maturity of three months or less; (ii) the exposure has an original maturity of six months or less and arises from the movement of goods across national borders; (b) exposures assigned to Grade A which are not short term shall be assigned a risk weight of 30 % where all of the following conditions are met: (i) the exposure does not meet any of the conditions set out in point (a); (ii) the institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is equal to or higher than 14 %; (iii) the institution’s leverage ratio is equal to or higher than 5 %; (c) exposures assigned to Grade A, B or C that do not meet the conditions set out in point (a) or (b) shall be assigned a risk weight in accordance with Table 1. Where an exposure to an institution is not denominated in the domestic currency of the jurisdiction of incorporation of that institution, or where that institution has booked the credit obligation in a branch in a different jurisdiction and the exposure is not in the domestic currency of the jurisdiction in which the branch operates, the risk weight assigned in accordance with point (a), (b) or (c), to exposures other than those with a maturity of one year or less stemming from self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods across national borders shall not be lower than the risk weight of an exposure to the central government of the country where the institution is incorporated.

Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their off-balance-sheet items with the potential to be converted into exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the following risk weight: (a) for all exposures for which institutions use one of the approaches set out in Article 132a: where: = the risk weight; i = the index denoting the CIU: RWAEi = the amount calculated in accordance with Article 132a for a CIUi; = the exposure value of the exposures of CIUi; Ai = the accounting value of assets of CIUi; and EQi = the accounting value of the equity of CIUi. (b) for all other exposures,. 2. Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of a minimum value commitment that meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article as the discounted present value of the guaranteed amount using a discount factor that is derived from a risk-free rate pursuant to Article 325l(2) or (3), as applicable. Institutions may reduce the exposure value of the minimum value commitment by any losses recognised with respect to the minimum value commitment under the applicable accounting standard. Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments that meet all the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article by multiplying the exposure value of those exposures by a conversion factor of 20 % and the risk weight derived under Article 132 or 152. 3. Institutions shall determine the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments in accordance with paragraph 2 where all the following conditions are met: (a) the off-balance-sheet exposure of the institution is a minimum value commitment for an investment into units or shares of one or more CIUs under which the institution is only obliged to pay out under the minimum value commitment where the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs is below a predetermined threshold at one or more points in time, as specified in the contract; (b) the CIU is any of the following: (i) a UCITS as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC; or (ii) an AIF as defined in point (a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU which solely invests in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets referred to in Article 50(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, where the mandate of the AIF does not allow a leverage higher than that allowed under Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC; (c) the current market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU underlying the minimum value commitment without considering the effect of the off-balance-sheet minimum value commitments covers or exceeds the present value of the threshold specified in the minimum value commitment; (d) when the excess of the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs over the present value of the minimum value commitment declines, the institution, or another undertaking in so far as it is covered by the supervision on a consolidated basis to which the institution itself is subject in accordance with this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2002/87/EC, can influence the composition of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs or limit the potential for a further reduction of the excess in other ways; (e) the ultimate direct or indirect beneficiary of the minimum value commitment is typically a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU.;   \n",

                                           1. For the purpose of Article 114, institutions may use credit assessments of an Export Credit Agency that the institution has nominated, if either of the following conditions is met: (a) it is a consensus risk score from export credit agencies participating in the OECD ‘Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits’; (b) the Export Credit Agency publishes its credit assessments, and the Export Credit Agency subscribes to the OECD agreed methodology, and the credit assessment is associated with one of the eight minimum export insurance premiums that the OECD agreed methodology establishes. An institution may revoke its nomination of an Export Credit Agency. An institution shall substantiate the revocation if there are concrete indications that the intention underlying the revocation is to reduce the capital adequacy requirements. 2. Exposures for which a credit assessment by an Export Credit Agency is recognised for risk weighting purposes shall be assigned a risk weight in accordance with Table 9.

The calculation of expected loss amounts shall be based on the same input figures of PD, LGD and the exposure value for each exposure as are used for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Article 151. 2. The expected loss amounts for securitised exposures shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 5. 3. The expected loss amount for exposures belonging to the ‘other non credit obligations assets’ exposure class referred to in point (g) of Article 147(2) shall be zero. 4. The expected loss amounts for exposures in the form of shares or units of a CIU referred to in Article 152 shall be calculated in accordance with the methods set out in this Article. 5. The expected loss (EL) and expected loss amounts for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities and retail exposures shall be calculated in accordance with the following formulae: expected loss (EL) = PD * LGD expected loss amount = EL [multiplied by] exposure value. For defaulted exposures (PD = 100 %) where institutions use own estimates of LGD, EL shall be ELBE, the institution’s best estimate of expected loss for the defaulted exposure in accordance with Article 181(1), point (h). 6. The EL values for specialised lending exposures where institutions use the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights shall be assigned in accordance with Table 2.

 Institutions shall validate their internal estimates subject to the following requirements: (a) institutions shall have robust systems in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of rating systems, processes, and the estimation of all relevant risk parameters. The internal validation process shall enable the institution to assess the performance of internal rating and risk estimation systems consistently and meaningfully; (b) institutions shall regularly compare realised default rates with estimated PDs for each grade and, where realised default rates are outside the expected range for that grade, institutions shall specifically analyse the reasons for the deviation. Institutions using own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall also perform analogous analysis for these estimates. Such comparisons shall make use of historical data that cover as long a period as possible. The institution shall document the methods and data used in such comparisons. This analysis and documentation shall be updated at least annually; (c) institutions shall also use other quantitative validation tools and comparisons with relevant external data sources. The analysis shall be based on data that are appropriate to the portfolio, are updated regularly, and cover a relevant observation period. Institutions' internal assessments of the performance of their rating systems shall be based on as long a period as possible; (d) the methods and data used for quantitative validation shall be consistent through time. Changes in estimation and validation methods and data (both data sources and periods covered) shall be documented; (e) institutions shall have sound internal standards for situations where deviations in realised PDs, LGDs, conversion factors and total losses, where EL is used, from expectations, become significant enough to call the validity of the estimates into question. These standards shall take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in default experience. Where realised values continue to be higher than expected values, institutions shall revise estimates upward to reflect their default and loss experience;   \n",

protection may, for exposures treated under the IRB Approach, apply the formula set out in Article 230, sequentially for each individual type of collateral. For that purpose, those institutions shall, after each step of recognising one individual type of FCP, reduce the remaining value of the unsecured exposure (EU) by the adjusted value of the collateral (ES) recognised in that step. In accordance with Article 230(1), the total of ES across all funded credit protection types shall be capped at the value of E·(1+HE), resulting in the following formula: where:   \n",

credit protection by which the transfer of risk is achieved and the underlying exposures shall be calculated as follows: (a) the maturity of the underlying exposures shall be taken to be the longest maturity of any of those exposures subject to a maximum of 5 years. The maturity of the credit protection shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 4; (b) an originator institution shall ignore any maturity mismatch in calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for securitisation positions subject to a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with this Section. For all other positions, the maturity mismatch treatment set out in Chapter 4 shall be applied in accordance with the following formula: where: RW* = risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), point (a); RWAss = risk-weighted exposure amounts for the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised, calculated on a pro-rata basis; RWSP = risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated under Article 251 as if there was no maturity mismatch; T = maturity of the underlying exposures, expressed in years; t = maturity of credit protection, expressed in years; t* = 0,25   \n",

For the purposes of Article 278, institutions shall calculate the interest rate risk category add-on for a given netting set as follows: where: AddOnIR = the interest rate risk category add-on; j = the index that denotes all the interest rate risk hedging sets established in accordance with point (a) of Article 277a(1) and with Article 277a(2) for the netting set; and = the interest rate risk category add-on for hedging set j calculated in accordance with paragraph 2. 2. Institutions shall calculate the interest rate risk category add-on for hedging set j as follows: where: єj = the hedging set supervisory factor coefficient of hedging set j determined in accordance with the applicable value specified in Article 280; SFIR = the supervisory factor for the interest rate risk category with a value equal to 0,5 %; and = the effective notional amount of hedging set j calculated in accordance with paragraph 3. 3. For the purpose of calculating the effective notional amount of hedging set j, institutions shall first map each transaction of the hedging set to the appropriate bucket in Table 2. They shall do so on the basis of the end date of each transaction as determined under point (a) of Article 279b(1): Table 2 Bucket End date (in years) 1 > 0 and <= 1 2 > 1 and <= 5 3 > 5 Institutions shall then calculate the effective notional amount of hedging set j in accordance with the following formula: where: where:   \n",

For the purposes of paragraph 2, institutions shall establish the relevant credit reference entities of the netting set in accordance with the following: (a) there shall be one credit reference entity for each issuer of a reference debt instrument that underlies a single-name transaction allocated to the credit risk category; single-name transactions shall be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the underlying reference debt instrument of those transactions is issued by the same issuer; (b) there shall be one credit reference entity for each group of reference debt instruments or single-name credit derivatives that underlie a multi-name transaction allocated to the credit risk category; multi-names transactions shall be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the group of underlying reference debt instruments or single-name credit derivatives of those transactions have the same constituents. 2. For the purposes of Article 278, institution shall calculate the credit risk category add-on for a given netting set as follows: where: AddOnCredit = credit risk category add-on; j = the index that denotes all the credit risk hedging sets established in accordance with point (c) of Article 277a(1) and with Article 277a(2) for the netting set; and = the credit risk category add-on for hedging set j calculated in accordance with paragraph 3. 3. Institutions shall calculate the credit risk category add-on for hedging set j as follows: where: = the credit risk category add-on for hedging set j; єj = the hedging set supervisory factor coefficient of hedging set j determined in accordance with Article 280; k = the index that denotes the credit reference entities of the netting set established in accordance with paragraph 1; = the correlation factor of the credit reference entity k; where the credit reference entity k has been established in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 1, , where the credit reference entity k has been established in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 1, ; and AddOn(Entityk) = the add-on for the credit reference entity k determined in accordance with paragraph 4. 4. Institutions shall calculate the add-on for the credit reference entity k as follows: where: = the effective notional amount of the credit reference entity k calculated as follows: where: l = the index that denotes the risk position; and = the supervisory factor applicable to the credit reference entity k calculated in accordance with paragraph 5. 5. Institutions shall calculate the supervisory factor applicable to the credit reference entity k as follows: (a) for the credit reference entity k established in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 1, shall be mapped to one of the six supervisory factors set out in Table 3 of this paragraph on the basis of an external credit assessment by a nominated ECAI of the corresponding individual issuer; for an individual issuer for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available: (i) an institution using the approach referred to in Chapter 3 shall map the internal rating of the individual issuer to one of the external credit assessments; (ii) an institution using the approach referred to in Chapter 2 shall assign to that credit reference entity; however, where an institution applies Article 128 to risk weight counterparty credit risk exposures to that individual issuer, shall be assigned to that credit reference entity; (b) for the credit reference entity k established in accordance with point (b) of paragraph 1: (i) where a risk position l assigned to the credit reference entity k is a credit index listed on a recognised exchange, shall be mapped to one of the two supervisory factors set out in Table 4 of this paragraph on the basis of the credit quality of the majority of its individual constituents; (ii) where a risk position l assigned to the credit reference entity k is not referred to in point (i) of this point, shall be the weighted average of the supervisory factors mapped to each constituent in accordance with the method set out in point (a), where the weights are defined by the proportion of notional of the constituents in that position.

An institution shall apply the following formula to calculate the own funds requirement for the exposures arising from its pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP and from unfunded contributions to such CCP: K = DF + UC where: K = the own funds requirement; DF = the pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP; and UC = the unfunded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP. 2. An institution shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for exposures arising from that institution's contribution to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP for the purposes of Article 92(3) as the own funds requirement, calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, multiplied by 12,5.”;   \n",

The correlation parameter ρk l between two sensitivities WS k and WS l within the same bucket shall be set as follows: ρkl = ρkl (name) · ρkl (tenor) · ρkl (basis) where: ρkl (name) shall be equal to 1 where the two names of sensitivities k and l are identical; it shall be equal to 35 % where the two names of sensitivities k and l are in buckets 1 to 18 in Article 325ah(1), Table 4, otherwise it shall be equal to 80 %; ρkl (tenor) shall be equal to 1 where the two vertices of the sensitivities k and l are identical, otherwise it shall be equal to 65 %; and ρkl (basis) shall be equal to 1 where the two sensitivities are related to the same curves, otherwise it shall be equal to 99,90 %. 2. The correlation parameters referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to bucket 18 in Table 4 of Article 325ah(1). The capital requirement for the delta risk aggregation formula within bucket 18 shall be equal to the sum of the absolute values of the net weighted sensitivities allocated to that bucket:   \n",

Between two sensitivities WS k and WS l within the same bucket, the correlation parameter ρk l shall be set as follows: ρkl = ρkl (tranche) · ρkl (tenor) · ρkl (basis) where: ρkl (tranche) shall be equal to 1 where the two names of sensitivities k and l are within the same bucket and are related to the same securitisation tranche (more than 80 % overlap in notional terms), otherwise it shall be equal to 40 %; ρkl (tenor) shall be equal to 1 where the two vertices of the sensitivities k and l are identical, otherwise it shall be equal to 80 %; and ρkl (basis) shall be equal to 1 where the two sensitivities are related to the same curves, otherwise it shall be equal to 99,90 %. 2. The correlation parameters referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to bucket 25 in Table 7 of Article 325am(1). The own funds requirement for the delta risk aggregation formula within bucket 25 shall be equal to the sum of the absolute values of the net weighted sensitivities allocated to that bucket:   \n",

The delta risk correlation parameter ρkl between two sensitivities WS k and WS l within the same bucket shall be set at 99,90 % where one is a sensitivity to an equity spot price and the other is a sensitivity to an equity repo rate and where both sensitivities are related to the same equity issuer name. 2. In other cases than the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the correlation parameter ρkl between two sensitivities WS k and WS l to equity spot price within the same bucket shall be set as follows: (a) 15 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category large market capitalisation, emerging market economy (bucket number 1, 2, 3 or 4); (b) 25 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category large market capitalisation, advanced economy (bucket number 5, 6, 7 or 8); (c) 7,5 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category small market capitalisation, emerging market economy (bucket number 9); (d) 12,5 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category small market capitalisation, advanced economy (bucket number 10); (e) 80 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under either index bucket (bucket number 12 or 13). 3. The correlation parameter ρkl between two sensitivities WSk and WSl to equity repo rates within the same bucket shall be set in accordance with points (a) to (d) of paragraph 2. 4. Between two sensitivities WS k and WS l within the same bucket where one is a sensitivity to an equity spot price and the other a sensitivity to an equity repo rate and both sensitivities relate to a different equity issuer name, the correlation parameter ρkl shall be set to the correlation parameters specified in paragraph 2, multiplied by 99,90 %. 5. The correlation parameters specified in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply to bucket 11. The capital requirement for the delta risk aggregation formula within bucket 11 shall be equal to the sum of the absolute values of the net weighted sensitivities allocated to that bucket:   \n",

A CCP shall calculate the hypothetical capital (KCCP) as follows: where: EBRMi = exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member; IMi = the initial margin posted to the CCP by clearing member i; DFi = the pre-funded contribution of clearing member i; RW = a risk weight of 20 %; capital ratio = 8 %. All values in the formula in the first subparagraph shall relate to the valuation at the end of the day before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged. 3. A CCP shall undertake the calculation required by paragraph 2 at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those of its clearing members which are institutions. 4. For the purpose of paragraph 3, EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following: (a) the frequency and dates of the calculation laid down in paragraph 2; (b) the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of calculation and reporting than those referred to in point (a). EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 50b General rules for the calculation of KCCP For the purposes of the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2), the following shall apply: (a) a CCP shall calculate the value of the exposures it has to its clearing members as follows: (i) for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(a) and (d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the mark-to-market method laid down in Article 274 thereof; (ii) for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b), (c) and (e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation. The exception set out in point (a) of Article 285(3) of that Regulation, shall not apply; (iii) for exposures arising from transactions not listed in Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which entails settlement risk only it shall calculate them in accordance with Part Three, Title V of that Regulation; (b) for institutions that fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the netting sets are the same as those defined in Part Three, Title II of that Regulation; (c) when calculating the values referred to in point (a), the CCP shall subtract from its exposures the collateral posted by its clearing members, appropriately reduced by the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; (e) where a CCP has exposures to one or more CCPs it shall treat any such exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP; (f) where a CCP has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the CCP shall consider that initial margin as prefunded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin; (h) when applying the Mark-to-Market Method as set out in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall replace the formula in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of that Regulation with the following: where the numerator of NGR is calculated in accordance with Article 274(1) of that Regulation and just before the variation margin is actually exchanged at the end of the settlement period, and the denominator is gross replacement cost; (i) where a CCP cannot calculate the value of NGR as set out in point (c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it shall: (i) notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities about its inability to calculate NGR and the reasons why it is unable to carry out the calculation; (ii) for a period of three months, it may use a value of NGR of 0,3 to perform the calculation of PCEred specified in point (h) of this Article; (j) where, at the end of the period specified in point (ii) of point (i), the CCP would still be unable to calculate the value of NGR, it shall do the following: (i) stop calculating KCCP; (ii) notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities that it has stopped calculating KCCP; (k) for the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure for options and swaptions in accordance with the Mark-to-Market Method specified in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall multiply the notional amount of the contract by the absolute value of the option's delta as set out in point (a) of Article 280(1) of that Regulation; (l) where a CCP has more than one default fund, it shall carry out the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2) for each default fund separately. Article 50c Reporting of information 1. For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall report the following information to those of its clearing members which are institutions and to their competent authorities: (a) the hypothetical capital (KCCP); (b) the sum of pre-funded contributions (DFCM); (c) the amount of its pre-funded financial resources that it is required to use — by law or due to a contractual agreement with its clearing members — to cover its losses following the default of one or more of its clearing members before using the default fund contributions of the remaining clearing members (DFCCP); (d) the total number of its clearing members (N); (e) the concentration factor (β), as set out in Article 50d. Where the CCP has more than one default fund, it shall report the information in the first subparagraph for each default fund separately. 2. The CCP shall notify those of its clearing members which are institutions at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those clearing members. 3. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following: (a) the uniform template for the purpose of the reporting specified in paragraph 1; (b) the frequency and dates of the reporting specified in paragraph 2; (c) the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of reporting than those referred to in point (b). EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 50d Calculation of specific items to be reported by the CCP For the purposes of Article 50c, the following shall apply: (a) where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources in parallel to the pre-funded contributions of its clearing members in a manner that makes those resources equivalent to pre-funded contributions of a clearing member in terms of how they absorb the losses incurred by the CCP in the case of the default or insolvency of one or more of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those resources to DFCM; (b) where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources to cover its losses due to the default of one or more of its clearing members after it has depleted its default fund, but before it calls on the contractually committed contributions of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those additional financial resources to the total amount of pre-funded contributions (DF) as follows: . (c) a CCP shall calculate the concentration factor (β) in accordance with the following formula: where: PCEred,i = the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with clearing member i; PCEred,1 = the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with the clearing member that has the largest PCEred value; PCEred,2 = the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with the clearing member that has the second largest PCEred value. (2) in Article 11(15), point (b) is deleted; (3) in Article 89, the following paragraph is inserted: ‘5a. Until 15 months after the date of entry into force of the latest of the regulatory technical standards referred to in Articles 16, 25, 26, 29, 34, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47 and 49, or until a decision is made under Article 14 on the authorisation of the CCP, whichever is earlier, that CCP shall apply the treatment specified in the third subparagraph of this paragraph. Until 15 months after the date of entry into force of the latest of the regulatory technical standards referred to in Articles 16, 26, 29, 34, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47 and 49, or until a decision is made under Article 25 on the recognition of the CCP, whichever is earlier, that CCP shall apply the treatment specified in the third subparagraph of this paragraph. Until the deadlines defined in the first two subparagraphs of this paragraph, and subject to the fourth subparagraph of this paragraph, where a CCP neither has a default fund nor has in place a binding arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the information it is to report in accordance with Article 50c(1) shall include the total amount of initial margin it has received from its clearing members. The deadlines referred to in the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph may be extended by six months in accordance with a Commission implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 497(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.’   \n",

For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point \\n\\n(b)(ii), of this paragraph, equivalent and additional local supervisory or regulatory requirements shall not include capital buffers equivalent to those defined in Article 128 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 2. For exposures to financial institutions that are treated as exposures to institutions in accordance with Article 119(5), for the purpose of assessing whether the conditions set out in paragraph 1, points \\n\\n(a)(ii) and \\n\\n(b)(ii), of this Article are met by those financial institutions, institutions shall assess whether those financial institutions meet or exceed any comparable prudential requirements. 3. Exposures assigned to Grade A, B or C in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be assigned a risk weight as follows: \\n\\n(a) exposures assigned to Grade A, B or C which meet any of the following conditions shall be assigned a risk weight for short-term exposures in accordance with Table 1: \\n\\n(i) the exposure has an original maturity of three months or less;\\n\\n(ii) the exposure has an original maturity of six months or less and arises from the movement of goods across national borders;\\n\\n(b) exposures assigned to Grade A which are not short term shall be assigned a risk weight of 30 % where all of the following conditions are met: \\n\\n(i) the exposure does not meet any of the conditions set out in point \\n\\n(a);\\n\\n(ii) the institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is equal to or higher than 14 %;\\n\\n(iii) the institution’s leverage ratio is equal to or higher than 5 %;\\n\\n(c) exposures assigned to Grade A, B or C that do not meet the conditions set out in point \\n\\n(a) or \\n\\n(b) shall be assigned a risk weight in accordance with Table 1. Where an exposure to an institution is not denominated in the domestic currency of the jurisdiction of incorporation of that institution, or where that institution has booked the credit obligation in a branch in a different jurisdiction and the exposure is not in the domestic currency of the jurisdiction in which the branch operates, the risk weight assigned in accordance with point \\n\\n(a),\\n\\n(b) or \\n\\n(c), to exposures other than those with a maturity of one year or less stemming from self-liquidating, trade-related contingent items that arise from the movement of goods across national borders shall not be lower than the risk weight of an exposure to the central government of the country where the institution is incorporated.

Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for their off-balance-sheet items with the potential to be converted into exposures in the form of units or shares in a CIU by multiplying the exposure values of those exposures calculated in accordance with Article 111, with the following risk weight: \\n\\n(a) for all exposures for which institutions use one of the approaches set out in Article 132a: where: = the risk weight; i = the index denoting the CIU: RWAEi = the amount calculated in accordance with Article 132a for a CIUi; = the exposure value of the exposures of CIUi; Ai = the accounting value of assets of CIUi; and EQi = the accounting value of the equity of CIUi.\\n\\n(b) for all other exposures,. 2. Institutions shall calculate the exposure value of a minimum value commitment that meets the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article as the discounted present value of the guaranteed amount using a discount factor that is derived from a risk-free rate pursuant to Article 325l(2) or \\n\\n(3), as applicable. Institutions may reduce the exposure value of the minimum value commitment by any losses recognised with respect to the minimum value commitment under the applicable accounting standard. Institutions shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments that meet all the conditions set out in paragraph 3 of this Article by multiplying the exposure value of those exposures by a conversion factor of 20 % and the risk weight derived under Article 132 or 152. 3. Institutions shall determine the risk-weighted exposure amount for off-balance-sheet exposures arising from minimum value commitments in accordance with paragraph 2 where all the following conditions are met: \\n\\n(a) the off-balance-sheet exposure of the institution is a minimum value commitment for an investment into units or shares of one or more CIUs under which the institution is only obliged to pay out under the minimum value commitment where the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs is below a predetermined threshold at one or more points in time, as specified in the contract;\\n\\n(b) the CIU is any of the following: \\n\\n(i) a UCITS as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC; or \\n\\n(ii) an AIF as defined in point \\n\\n(a) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2011/61/EU which solely invests in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets referred to in Article 50(1) of Directive 2009/65/EC, where the mandate of the AIF does not allow a leverage higher than that allowed under Article 51(3) of Directive 2009/65/EC;\\n\\n(c) the current market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU underlying the minimum value commitment without considering the effect of the off-balance-sheet minimum value commitments covers or exceeds the present value of the threshold specified in the minimum value commitment;\\n\\n(d) when the excess of the market value of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs over the present value of the minimum value commitment declines, the institution, or another undertaking in so far as it is covered by the supervision on a consolidated basis to which the institution itself is subject in accordance with this Regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU or Directive 2002/87/EC, can influence the composition of the underlying exposures of the CIU or CIUs or limit the potential for a further reduction of the excess in other ways;\\n\\n(e) the ultimate direct or indirect beneficiary of the minimum value commitment is typically a retail client as defined in point \\n\\n(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU.;   \n",

  1. For the purpose of Article 114, institutions may use credit assessments of an Export Credit Agency that the institution has nominated, if either of the following conditions is met: \\n\\n(a) it is a consensus risk score from export credit agencies participating in the OECD ‘Arrangement on Guidelines for Officially Supported Export Credits’;\\n\\n(b) the Export Credit Agency publishes its credit assessments, and the Export Credit Agency subscribes to the OECD agreed methodology, and the credit assessment is associated with one of the eight minimum export insurance premiums that the OECD agreed methodology establishes. An institution may revoke its nomination of an Export Credit Agency. An institution shall substantiate the revocation if there are concrete indications that the intention underlying the revocation is to reduce the capital adequacy requirements. 2. Exposures for which a credit assessment by an Export Credit Agency is recognised for risk weighting purposes shall be assigned a risk weight in accordance with Table 9.

The calculation of expected loss amounts shall be based on the same input figures of PD, LGD and the exposure value for each exposure as are used for the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts in accordance with Article 151. 2. The expected loss amounts for securitised exposures shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 5. 3. The expected loss amount for exposures belonging to the ‘other non credit obligations assets’ exposure class referred to in point \\n\\n(g) of Article 147(2) shall be zero. 4. The expected loss amounts for exposures in the form of shares or units of a CIU referred to in Article 152 shall be calculated in accordance with the methods set out in this Article. 5. The expected loss (EL) and expected loss amounts for exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks, regional governments, local authorities and public sector entities and retail exposures shall be calculated in accordance with the following formulae: expected loss (EL) = PD * LGD expected loss amount = EL [multiplied by] exposure value. For defaulted exposures (PD = 100 %) where institutions use own estimates of LGD, EL shall be ELBE, the institution’s best estimate of expected loss for the defaulted exposure in accordance with Article 181(1), point \\n\\n(h). 6. The EL values for specialised lending exposures where institutions use the methods set out in Article 153(5) for assigning risk weights shall be assigned in accordance with Table 2.

estimates subject to the following requirements: \\n\\n(a) institutions shall have robust systems in place to validate the accuracy and consistency of rating systems, processes, and the estimation of all relevant risk parameters. The internal validation process shall enable the institution to assess the performance of internal rating and risk estimation systems consistently and meaningfully;\\n\\n(b) institutions shall regularly compare realised default rates with estimated PDs for each grade and, where realised default rates are outside the expected range for that grade, institutions shall specifically analyse the reasons for the deviation. Institutions using own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall also perform analogous analysis for these estimates. Such comparisons shall make use of historical data that cover as long a period as possible. The institution shall document the methods and data used in such comparisons. This analysis and documentation shall be updated at least annually;\\n\\n(c) institutions shall also use other quantitative validation tools and comparisons with relevant external data sources. The analysis shall be based on data that are appropriate to the portfolio, are updated regularly, and cover a relevant observation period. Institutions' internal assessments of the performance of their rating systems shall be based on as long a period as possible;\\n\\n(d) the methods and data used for quantitative validation shall be consistent through time. Changes in estimation and validation methods and data (both data sources and periods covered) shall be documented;\\n\\n(e) institutions shall have sound internal standards for situations where deviations in realised PDs, LGDs, conversion factors and total losses, where EL is used, from expectations, become significant enough to call the validity of the estimates into question. These standards shall take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in default experience.

under the IRB Approach, apply the formula set out in Article 230, sequentially for each individual type of collateral. For that purpose, those institutions shall, after each step of recognising one individual type of FCP, reduce the remaining value of the unsecured exposure (EU) by the adjusted value of the collateral (ES) recognised in that step. In accordance with Article 230(1), the total of ES across all funded credit protection types shall be capped at the value of E·(1+HE), resulting in the following formula: where:   \n",

risk is achieved and the underlying exposures shall be calculated as follows: \\n\\n(a) the maturity of the underlying exposures shall be taken to be the longest maturity of any of those exposures subject to a maximum of 5 years. The maturity of the credit protection shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 4;\\n\\n(b) an originator institution shall ignore any maturity mismatch in calculating risk-weighted exposure amounts for securitisation positions subject to a risk weight of 1 250 % in accordance with this Section. For all other positions, the maturity mismatch treatment set out in Chapter 4 shall be applied in accordance with the following formula: where: RW* = risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Article 92(4), point \\n\\n(a); RWAss = risk-weighted exposure amounts for the underlying exposures as if they had not been securitised, calculated on a pro-rata basis; RWSP = risk-weighted exposure amounts calculated under Article 251 as if there was no maturity mismatch; T = maturity of the underlying exposures, expressed in years; t = maturity of credit protection, expressed in years; t* = 0,25   \n",

For the purposes of Article 278, institutions shall calculate the interest rate risk category add-on for a given netting set as follows: where: AddOnIR = the interest rate risk category add-on; j = the index that denotes all the interest rate risk hedging sets established in accordance with point \\n\\n(a) of Article 277a(1) and with Article 277a(2) for the netting set; and = the interest rate risk category add-on for hedging set j calculated in accordance with paragraph 2. 2. Institutions shall calculate the interest rate risk category add-on for hedging set j as follows: where: єj = the hedging set supervisory factor coefficient of hedging set j determined in accordance with the applicable value specified in Article 280; SFIR = the supervisory factor for the interest rate risk category with a value equal to 0,5 %; and = the effective notional amount of hedging set j calculated in accordance with paragraph 3. 3. For the purpose of calculating the effective notional amount of hedging set j, institutions shall first map each transaction of the hedging set to the appropriate bucket in Table 2. They shall do so on the basis of the end date of each transaction as determined under point \\n\\n(a) of Article 279b(1): Table 2 Bucket End date (in years) 1 > 0 and <= 1 2 > 1 and <= 5 3 > 5 Institutions shall then calculate the effective notional amount of hedging set j in accordance with the following formula: where: where:   \n",

For the purposes of paragraph 2, institutions shall establish the relevant credit reference entities of the netting set in accordance with the following: \\n\\n(a) there shall be one credit reference entity for each issuer of a reference debt instrument that underlies a single-name transaction allocated to the credit risk category; single-name transactions shall be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the underlying reference debt instrument of those transactions is issued by the same issuer;\\n\\n(b) there shall be one credit reference entity for each group of reference debt instruments or single-name credit derivatives that underlie a multi-name transaction allocated to the credit risk category; multi-names transactions shall be assigned to the same credit reference entity only where the group of underlying reference debt instruments or single-name credit derivatives of those transactions have the same constituents. 2. For the purposes of Article 278, institution shall calculate the credit risk category add-on for a given netting set as follows: where: AddOnCredit = credit risk category add-on; j = the index that denotes all the credit risk hedging sets established in accordance with point \\n\\n(c) of Article 277a(1) and with Article 277a(2) for the netting set; and = the credit risk category add-on for hedging set j calculated in accordance with paragraph 3. 3. Institutions shall calculate the credit risk category add-on for hedging set j as follows: where: = the credit risk category add-on for hedging set j; єj = the hedging set supervisory factor coefficient of hedging set j determined in accordance with Article 280; k = the index that denotes the credit reference entities of the netting set established in accordance with paragraph 1; = the correlation factor of the credit reference entity k; where the credit reference entity k has been established in accordance with point \\n\\n(a) of paragraph 1, , where the credit reference entity k has been established in accordance with point \\n\\n(b) of paragraph 1, ; and AddOn(Entityk) = the add-on for the credit reference entity k determined in accordance with paragraph 4. 4. Institutions shall calculate the add-on for the credit reference entity k as follows: where: = the effective notional amount of the credit reference entity k calculated as follows: where: l = the index that denotes the risk position; and = the supervisory factor applicable to the credit reference entity k calculated in accordance with paragraph 5. 5. Institutions shall calculate the supervisory factor applicable to the credit reference entity k as follows: \\n\\n(a) for the credit reference entity k established in accordance with point \\n\\n(a) of paragraph 1, shall be mapped to one of the six supervisory factors set out in Table 3 of this paragraph on the basis of an external credit assessment by a nominated ECAI of the corresponding individual issuer; for an individual issuer for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available: \\n\\n(i) an institution using the approach referred to in Chapter 3 shall map the internal rating of the individual issuer to one of the external credit assessments;\\n\\n(ii) an institution using the approach referred to in Chapter 2 shall assign to that credit reference entity; however, where an institution applies Article 128 to risk weight counterparty credit risk exposures to that individual issuer, shall be assigned to that credit reference entity;\\n\\n(b) for the credit reference entity k established in accordance with point \\n\\n(b) of paragraph 1: \\n\\n(i) where a risk position l assigned to the credit reference entity k is a credit index listed on a recognised exchange, shall be mapped to one of the two supervisory factors set out in Table 4 of this paragraph on the basis of the credit quality of the majority of its individual constituents;\\n\\n(ii) where a risk position l assigned to the credit reference entity k is not referred to in point \\n\\n(i) of this point, shall be the weighted average of the supervisory factors mapped to each constituent in accordance with the method set out in point \\n\\n(a), where the weights are defined by the proportion of notional of the constituents in that position.

An institution shall apply the following formula to calculate the own funds requirement for the exposures arising from its pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP and from unfunded contributions to such CCP: K = DF + UC where: K = the own funds requirement; DF = the pre-funded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP; and UC = the unfunded contributions to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP. 2. An institution shall calculate the risk-weighted exposure amounts for exposures arising from that institution's contribution to the default fund of a non-qualifying CCP for the purposes of Article 92(3) as the own funds requirement, calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, multiplied by 12,5.”;   \n",

The correlation parameters referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to bucket 18 in Table 4 of Article 325ah(1). The capital requirement for the delta risk aggregation formula within bucket 18 shall be equal to the sum of the absolute values of the net weighted sensitivities allocated to that bucket:   \n",

The correlation parameters referred to in paragraph 1 shall not apply to bucket 25 in Table 7 of Article 325am(1). The own funds requirement for the delta risk aggregation formula within bucket 25 shall be equal to the sum of the absolute values of the net weighted sensitivities allocated to that bucket:   \n",

The delta risk correlation parameter ρkl between two sensitivities WS k and WS l within the same bucket shall be set at 99,90 % where one is a sensitivity to an equity spot price and the other is a sensitivity to an equity repo rate and where both sensitivities are related to the same equity issuer name. 2. In other cases than the cases referred to in paragraph 1, the correlation parameter ρkl between two sensitivities WS k and WS l to equity spot price within the same bucket shall be set as follows: \\n\\n(a) 15 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category large market capitalisation, emerging market economy (bucket number 1, 2, 3 or 4);\\n\\n(b) 25 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category large market capitalisation, advanced economy (bucket number 5, 6, 7 or 8);\\n\\n(c) 7,5 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category small market capitalisation, emerging market economy (bucket number 9);\\n\\n(d) 12,5 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under the category small market capitalisation, advanced economy (bucket number 10);\\n\\n(e) 80 % between two sensitivities within the same bucket that fall under either index bucket (bucket number 12 or 13). 3. The correlation parameter ρkl between two sensitivities WSk and WSl to equity repo rates within the same bucket shall be set in accordance with points \\n\\n(a) to \\n\\n(d) of paragraph 2. 4. Between two sensitivities WS k and WS l within the same bucket where one is a sensitivity to an equity spot price and the other a sensitivity to an equity repo rate and both sensitivities relate to a different equity issuer name, the correlation parameter ρkl shall be set to the correlation parameters specified in paragraph 2, multiplied by 99,90 %. 5. The correlation parameters specified in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply to bucket 11. The capital requirement for the delta risk aggregation formula within bucket 11 shall be equal to the sum of the absolute values of the net weighted sensitivities allocated to that bucket:   \n",

Where the excess has not persisted for more than 10 days, the additional capital requirement shall be 200 % of the requirements referred to in paragraph 1, on these components. 3. As from 10 days after the excess has occurred, the components of the excess, selected in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be allocated to the appropriate line in Column 1 of Table 1 in ascending order of specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or requirements in Article 299 and Part Three, Title V. The additional own funds requirement shall be equal to the sum of the specific-risk requirements in Part Three, Title IV, Chapter 2 and/or the Article 299 and Part Three, Title V requirements on these components, multiplied by the corresponding factor in Column 2 of Table 1.

       "740  Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 is amended as follows: \\n\\n(1) the following Chapter is added in Title IV: ‘CHAPTER 4 Calculations and reporting for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 Article 50a Calculation of KCCP 1. For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms ( *1 ), a CCP shall calculate KCCP as specified in paragraph 2 of this Article for all contracts and transactions it clears for all its clearing members falling within the coverage of the given default fund. 2. A CCP shall calculate the hypothetical capital (KCCP) as follows: where: EBRMi = exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member; IMi = the initial margin posted to the CCP by clearing member i; DFi = the pre-funded contribution of clearing member i; RW = a risk weight of 20 %; capital ratio = 8 %. All values in the formula in the first subparagraph shall relate to the valuation at the end of the day before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged. 3. A CCP shall undertake the calculation required by paragraph 2 at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those of its clearing members which are institutions. 4. For the purpose of paragraph 3, EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following: \\n\\n(a) the frequency and dates of the calculation laid down in paragraph 2;\\n\\n(b) the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of calculation and reporting than those referred to in point \\n\\n(a). EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 50b General rules for the calculation of KCCP For the purposes of the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2), the following shall apply: \\n\\n(a) a CCP shall calculate the value of the exposures it has to its clearing members as follows: \\n\\n(i) for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(a) and \\n\\n(d) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the mark-to-market method laid down in Article 274 thereof;\\n\\n(ii) for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in Article 301(1)(b),\\n\\n(c) and \\n\\n(e) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 it shall calculate them in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 223 of that Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments, specified in Articles 223 and 224 of that Regulation. The exception set out in point \\n\\n(a) of Article 285(3) of that Regulation, shall not apply;\\n\\n(iii) for exposures arising from transactions not listed in Article 301(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and which entails settlement risk only it shall calculate them in accordance with Part Three, Title V of that Regulation;\\n\\n(b) for institutions that fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the netting sets are the same as those defined in Part Three, Title II of that Regulation;\\n\\n(c) when calculating the values referred to in point \\n\\n(a), the CCP shall subtract from its exposures the collateral posted by its clearing members, appropriately reduced by the supervisory volatility adjustments in accordance with the Financial Collateral Comprehensive Method specified in Article 224 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;\\n\\n(e) where a CCP has exposures to one or more CCPs it shall treat any such exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP;\\n\\n(f) where a CCP has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the CCP shall consider that initial margin as prefunded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin;\\n\\n(h) when applying the Mark-to-Market Method as set out in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall replace the formula in point \\n\\n(c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of that Regulation with the following: where the numerator of NGR is calculated in accordance with Article 274(1) of that Regulation and just before the variation margin is actually exchanged at the end of the settlement period, and the denominator is gross replacement cost;\\n\\n(i) where a CCP cannot calculate the value of NGR as set out in point \\n\\n(c)(ii) of Article 298(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, it shall: \\n\\n(i) notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities about its inability to calculate NGR and the reasons why it is unable to carry out the calculation;\\n\\n(ii) for a period of three months, it may use a value of NGR of 0,3 to perform the calculation of PCEred specified in point \\n\\n(h) of this Article;\\n\\n(j) where, at the end of the period specified in point \\n\\n(ii) of point \\n\\n(i), the CCP would still be unable to calculate the value of NGR, it shall do the following: \\n\\n(i) stop calculating KCCP;\\n\\n(ii) notify those of its clearing members which are institutions and their competent authorities that it has stopped calculating KCCP;\\n\\n(k) for the purpose of calculating the potential future exposure for options and swaptions in accordance with the Mark-to-Market Method specified in Article 274 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall multiply the notional amount of the contract by the absolute value of the option's delta as set out in point \\n\\n(a) of Article 280(1) of that Regulation;\\n\\n(l) where a CCP has more than one default fund, it shall carry out the calculation laid down in Article 50a(2) for each default fund separately. Article 50c Reporting of information 1. For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a CCP shall report the following information to those of its clearing members which are institutions and to their competent authorities: \\n\\n(a) the hypothetical capital (KCCP);\\n\\n(b) the sum of pre-funded contributions (DFCM);\\n\\n(c) the amount of its pre-funded financial resources that it is required to use — by law or due to a contractual agreement with its clearing members — to cover its losses following the default of one or more of its clearing members before using the default fund contributions of the remaining clearing members (DFCCP);\\n\\n(d) the total number of its clearing members \\n\\n(N);\\n\\n(e) the concentration factor (β), as set out in Article 50d. Where the CCP has more than one default fund, it shall report the information in the first subparagraph for each default fund separately. 2. The CCP shall notify those of its clearing members which are institutions at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those clearing members. 3. EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following: \\n\\n(a) the uniform template for the purpose of the reporting specified in paragraph 1;\\n\\n(b) the frequency and dates of the reporting specified in paragraph 2;\\n\\n(c) the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of reporting than those referred to in point \\n\\n(b). EBA shall submit those draft implementing technical standards to the Commission by 1 January 2014. Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the implementing technical standards referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010. Article 50d Calculation of specific items to be reported by the CCP For the purposes of Article 50c, the following shall apply: \\n\\n(a) where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources in parallel to the pre-funded contributions of its clearing members in a manner that makes those resources equivalent to pre-funded contributions of a clearing member in terms of how they absorb the losses incurred by the CCP in the case of the default or insolvency of one or more of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those resources to DFCM;\\n\\n(b) where the rules of a CCP provide that it use part or all of its financial resources to cover its losses due to the default of one or more of its clearing members after it has depleted its default fund, but before it calls on the contractually committed contributions of its clearing members, the CCP shall add the corresponding amount of those additional financial resources to the total amount of pre-funded contributions (DF) as follows: .\\n\\n(c) a CCP shall calculate the concentration factor (β) in accordance with the following formula: where: PCEred,i = the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with clearing member i; PCEred,1 = the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with the clearing member that has the largest PCEred value; PCEred,2 = the reduced figure for potential future credit exposure for all contracts and transaction of a CCP with the clearing member that has the second largest PCEred value.\\n\\n(2) in Article 11(15), point \\n\\n(b) is deleted;\\n\\n(3) in Article 89, the following paragraph is inserted: ‘5a. Until 15 months after the date of entry into force of the latest of the regulatory technical standards referred to in Articles 16, 25, 26, 29, 34, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47 and 49, or until a decision is made under Article 14 on the authorisation of the CCP, whichever is earlier, that CCP shall apply the treatment specified in the third subparagraph of this paragraph. Until 15 months after the date of entry into force of the latest of the regulatory technical standards referred to in Articles 16, 26, 29, 34, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47 and 49, or until a decision is made under Article 25 on the recognition of the CCP, whichever is earlier, that CCP shall apply the treatment specified in the third subparagraph of this paragraph. Until the deadlines defined in the first two subparagraphs of this paragraph, and subject to the fourth subparagraph of this paragraph, where a CCP neither has a default fund nor has in place a binding arrangement with its clearing members that allows it to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions, the information it is to report in accordance with Article 50c(1) shall include the total amount of initial margin it has received from its clearing members. The deadlines referred to in the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph may be extended by six months in accordance with a Commission implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 497(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.’   \n",

The internal validation process shall enable the institution to assess the performance of internal rating and risk estimation systems consistently and meaningfully;\\n\\n(b) institutions shall regularly compare realised default rates with estimated PDs for each grade and, where realised default rates are outside the expected range for that grade, institutions shall specifically analyse the reasons for the deviation. Institutions using own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors shall also perform analogous analysis for these estimates. Such comparisons shall make use of historical data that cover as long a period as possible. The institution shall document the methods and data used in such comparisons. This analysis and documentation shall be updated at least annually;\\n\\n(c) institutions shall also use other quantitative validation tools and comparisons with relevant external data sources. The analysis shall be based on data that are appropriate to the portfolio, are updated regularly, and cover a relevant observation period.

Changes in estimation and validation methods and data (both data sources and periods covered) shall be documented;\\n\\n(e) institutions shall have sound internal standards for situations where deviations in realised PDs, LGDs, conversion factors and total losses, where EL is used, from expectations, become significant enough to call the validity of the estimates into question. These standards shall take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in default experience.

For the purposes of Article 308 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms ( *1 ), a CCP shall calculate KCCP as specified in paragraph 2 of this Article for all contracts and transactions it clears for all its clearing members falling within the coverage of the given default fund. 2. A CCP shall calculate the hypothetical capital (KCCP) as follows: where: EBRMi = exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member; IMi = the initial margin posted to the CCP by clearing member i; DFi = the pre-funded contribution of clearing member i; RW = a risk weight of 20 %; capital ratio = 8 %. All values in the formula in the first subparagraph shall relate to the valuation at the end of the day before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged. 3. A CCP shall undertake the calculation required by paragraph 2 at least quarterly or more frequently where required by the competent authorities of those of its clearing members which are institutions. 4. For the purpose of paragraph 3, EBA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to specify the following: \\n\\n(a) the frequency and dates of the calculation laid down in paragraph 2;\\n\\n(b) the situations in which the competent authority of an institution acting as a clearing member may require higher frequencies of calculation and reporting than those referred to in point \\n\\n(a).
