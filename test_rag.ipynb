    "  - Automatically assign Category_2 (Level) based on text complexity\n",
    "- Methods:\n",
    "  - Zero-shot classification using LLM\n",
    "  - Or embedding similarity to category descriptions\n",
    "  - Or keyword/rule-based assignment\n",

    "| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Embedding Generation\n",
    "- Create embeddings for all document texts (OpenAI/Claude)\n",
    "- Store embeddings with metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Question Processing\n",
    "- Embed each incoming question\n",
    "- Categorize questions into both category types using same method as documents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Four Retrieval Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy A: Pure Embedding Similarity\n",
    "- Compute cosine similarity between question and document embeddings\n",
    "- Return top 5 most similar documents\n",
    "- Cost: Embedding lookup only\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy B: Category Filtering\n",
    "- Filter documents matching question's categories\n",
    "- Return up to 5 matches (by TOC order)\n",
    "- Cost: Metadata query only\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy C: Hybrid (Categories + Similarity)\n",
    "- Filter by categories first\n",
    "- Rank filtered results by embedding similarity\n",
    "- Return top 5\n",
    "- Cost: Filtering + embedding lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy D: Full Context with Cache\n",
    "- Load entire document into LLM context\n",
    "- Use prompt caching for cost reduction\n",
    "- Let LLM select 5 most relevant sections\n",
    "- Cost: Full LLM inference (reduced with caching)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "For each question and strategy, calculate:\n",
    "- **Matches**: Number of retrieved TOCs that appear in golden source\n",
    "- **Precision@5**: Matches / 5\n",
    "- **Cost**: Based on API calls (embeddings, LLM tokens)\n",
    "- **Latency**: Time to retrieve results\n",
